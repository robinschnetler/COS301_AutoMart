\section{Vision}
Dot Slash\textsuperscript{TM} currently hosts a website for AutoMart for the sale of new and second hand vehicles, motorcycles and trucks. Users place their advertisements by entering textual data along with images of the vehicle onto the website. The system currently has an intelligent textual parser that parses the data to extrapolate relevant vehicle properties and create a valid advertisement. Once this parsing is complete, the advert is placed into a temporary database which is then manually approved to ensure that the advert complies with their terms and conditions.

AutoMart is currently facing spamming, poor quality images and misrepresentation problems. At the moment bots and users are able upload any images onto the website. Many of the adverts do not contain car images or contain car images of inferior quality.

Dot Slash has a vision of implementing a car recognition system that will prevent users from uploading any irrelevant or inferior quality images onto the AutoMart website. The subsystem needs to determine if there is a car in the image wanting to be uploaded. If there is car in the image, the make, the model and the colour of the car need to be identified. The subsystem also needs to generate a rating for the image. 

Dot Slash has assigned \#YOCO team to implement the subsystem.
