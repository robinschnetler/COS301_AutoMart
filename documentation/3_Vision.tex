\section{Vision}
dot slash(TM) currently has a website in place for AutoMart for sale of used and new vehicles, including motorcycles and trucks. Users place their advertisements by entering textual data along with the vehicle images on the website. The system currently has a AI textual parser that takes the data and extrapolates relevant vehicle properties to create an advertisement. The advertisement consists of textual data representing vehicle details as well as the images of the vehicle being advertised. This data is then entered into the existing AutoMart's database.

AutoMart currently faces spamming, poor image quality and misrepresentation problems. Spamming is caused by bots that upload irrelevant images to their system, causing many invalid advertisements. Currently there is no image inspection, which allows users to upload images of inferior quality, which may not result in an invalid advertisement but rather a bad one. Finally, they have a AI text parser which parser the textual data and generates relevant vehicle details which are used to represent the advertisement in the database. However they are facing a problem where the AI classifies the text data different from the image uploaded along with that data. This resulting in advertisement representing two different vehicles.

The aim of the project is to create a subsystem that will ensure that only car images of good quality are allowed to be uploaded to the database. The system also needs to ensure that the textual data and the image correspond to each other and represent the same vehicle.
