\section{Architecture Requirements}
\subsection{Access Channel Requirements}
The system dealing with evaluating the advert, images specifically, needs to be implemented in the back end of the website. Therefore there is no graphical user interface that the user will interact with. The user will only get messages back from the system stating the success or failure of the advert to be uploaded. The messages will be displayed in the browser which will be implemented by dot slash. 

The training part for car recognition will have a graphical user interface that will guide the user in training the classifiers with the new data to ensure that the system stays up to date with the latest cars on the market. This part of the system will be accessible through a computer running on Windows OS.

\subsection{Quality Requirements}

\subsubsection{Performance}
The system must be used in real time when a user creates and advert for a vehicle that they wish to sell. The system must therefore process and classify the image in a maximum of 2 seconds per feature(car, make, model, colour) and a further 2 seconds to generate a rating for the image.

The detection of one feature, through experience has not taken more than 2 seconds. We have achieved this through OpenCV\'s object recognition framework. All features to be detected will use the exact same framework. hence we can infer this time constraint. 
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The core of the system depend on the existence of a classifier xml file that consists of the weights required for the classification algorithm. Each feature has its own classification xml file. For our system to be reliable, a backup of each xml file must be stored on a secure system. The loss or corruption of the xml file for a feature will result in the inability of the classification of that feature. 
\subsubsection{Scalability}

\subsubsection{Flexibility}
The system needs to be trained for each classification. One classification cannot work for another feature detection use case.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}

\subsubsection{Integrability}

\subsubsection{Cost}

\subsubsection{Usability}

It is also essential that the information we obtain from the image is accurate since the basis of AutoMart\'s business operations will rely on how well we implement our algorithm and how accurate it is.

\subsection{Integration Requirements}
The final product needs to integrate with current AutoMart system. This is to be achieved by implementing an API through which AutoMarts website will be able to access the functions needed to determine adverts validity.

\subsection{Architecture Constraints}
The system needs to be implemented in C\#. The system also needs to be able to communicate with the Microsoft SQL Server.
