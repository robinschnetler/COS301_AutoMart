\section{Architecture Requirements}
\subsection{Access Channel Requirements}
The system dealing with evaluating the advert, images specifically, needs to be implemented in the back end of the website. Therefore there is no graphical user interface that the user will interact with. The user will only get messages back from the system stating the success or failure of the advert to be uploaded. The messages will be displayed in the browser which will be implemented by dot slash. 

The training part for car recognition will have a graphical user interface that will guide the user in training the classifiers with the new data to ensure that the system stays up to date with the latest cars on the market. This part of the system will be accessible through a computer running on Windows OS.

\subsection{Quality Requirements}

\subsubsection{Performance}
The system must be used in real time when a user creates and advert for a vehicle that they wish to sell. The system must therefore process and classify the image in a maximum of 2 seconds per feature(car, make, model, colour) and a further 2 seconds to generate a rating for the image.

The detection of one feature, through experience has not taken more than 2 seconds. We have achieved this through OpenCV\'s object recognition framework. All features to be detected will use the exact same framework. hence we can infer this time constraint. 
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system will classify the feature at least 8 out of 10 times.

The openCV framework suggests usage of atleast 5000 images when classifying faces. This has worked and historical data proves that this had been effective. Our system will be using 5000 images for each characteristic.
\subsubsection{Scalability}
The system will be able to detect more than one feature in simulated concurrency.

We will achieve this by using threads to for the classification process.
\subsubsection{Flexibility}
The system needs to be trained for each classification. One classification cannot work for another feature detection use case. But the inability of classification of one feature will not result in a system failure. 

This will be achieved using the rating of an image based on the features that the system was, in fact, able to detect.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The addition of new feature classifiers will be pluggable at a later stage. 

We are using SOLID design principles and have implemented a strategy design pattern for each of the feature classifiers. At a later stage, if a new feature is required, it will merely have to be trained and plugged into the current strategy framework.

It is also essential that the information we obtain from the image is accurate since the basis of AutoMart\'s business operations will rely on how well we implement our algorithm and how accurate it is.

\subsection{Integration Requirements}
The final product needs to integrate with current AutoMart system. This is to be achieved by implementing an API through which AutoMarts website will be able to access the functions needed to determine adverts validity.

\subsection{Architecture Constraints}
The system needs to be implemented in C\#. The system also needs to be able to communicate with the Microsoft SQL Server.
