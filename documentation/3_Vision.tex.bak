\section{Vision}
Dot Slash\textsuperscript{TM} currently hosts a website for AutoMart for the sale of new and secondhand vehicles, motorcycles and trucks. Users place their advertisements by entering textual data along with images of the vehicle onto the website. The system currently has an intelligent textual parser that parses the data to extrapolate relevant vehicle properties and create a valid advertisement. Once this parsing is complete, the advert is placed into a temporary database which is then manually approved to ensure that the advert complies with their terms and conditions.

AutoMart currently faces spamming, poor image quality and misrepresentation problems. Bots upload irrelevant images to their system, resulting in many invalid advertisements. Without an image processing utility integrated with the system, a user is still able to post inferior images as a valid advertisement- clearly, a problem. Using the new image processing utitlity, the system can now validate the images uploaded alongside the data generated by the textual parser before the advert reaches the beginning of the validation queue. 

This utility will, for the remainder of this document, be reffered to as the Yoco utility.
